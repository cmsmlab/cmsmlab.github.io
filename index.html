Our group develops new mathematical models and advanced numerical methods to investigate the fundamental and applied mechanics of soft and architected materials, emphasizing the interplay among mechanical deformation, transport phenomena, and electrical polarization across scales. Through theoretical modeling, numerical simulation, and targeted experiments, we aim to understand and computationally design multifunctional polymeric and biomimetic materials, including those that generate and sense electricity under large deformations, droplet-based tissue-like systems, architected structures inspired by biological interfaces, and synthetic membranes. Our interdisciplinary work advances fundamental knowledge in soft-matter mechanics and guides the design of new materials for both established and emerging applications.
