      Our group investigates the fundamental mechanics of soft and architected materials,
      emphasizing the interplay among mechanical deformation, transport phenomena,
      and electrical polarization. Through theoretical modeling, multiscale computational
      simulation, and targeted experiments, we aim to understand and computationally design
      multifunctional polymeric and biomimetic materialsâ€”including stretchable polymers that
      generate electricity, architected structures inspired by biological interfaces,
      synthetic tissue-like systems, and membrane materials with selective transport properties.
      Our interdisciplinary work advances fundamental knowledge in soft matter mechanics
      and guides the design of materials for energy harvesting, filtration, and beyond.
