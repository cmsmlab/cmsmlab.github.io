Ashkan gave a talk titled "A subdivision-stabilized B-spline material point
method for nonlinear nearly incompressible solids" in the [Material Point
Method Workshop](https://www.mpmworkshop.com/) . The workshop was held at UT
Austin from 29th to 30th September 2022. Kudos to Ashkan for this fantastic
talk!
