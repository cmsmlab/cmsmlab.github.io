Minneapolis, October 8-11, 2023

PhD students, Ashkan, Derya, Jun, and Ekim, participated in the 2023 Society
of Engineering Science Annual Technical Meeting in Minneapolis.

Ashkan presented on "a subdivision-stabilized isogeometric material point
method for strongly coupled diffusion in hydrogels, a new Eulerian-Lagrangian
formulation for highly deformable materials with diffusion.
