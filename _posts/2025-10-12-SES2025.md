Presented two talks at the **Society of Engineering Science (SES) 2025 Conference** in Atlanta, GA:

- **B. Dortdivanlioglu, J. Wang, A. Umurhan** — *A Micromechanical, Coupled Mechanics Approach to Strain-Gradient-Driven Polarization in Soft Polymers*  
- **J. Wang, B. Dortdivanlioglu** — *Size Effects in Soft Material Instabilities Using a Strain-Gradient Approach*  

Both presentations highlighted recent advances from our group in understanding electromechanical coupling and size-dependent behavior in highly deformable polymeric materials.
