We develop advanced computational modeling and physics-based simulation
techniques for i) enhancing our understanding of dynamic shape, topology, and
functional changes in soft materials in nature, ii) elucidating the complete
interplay between multi-physics materials and their physical/(bio)chemical
stimuli, and iii) capturing lower-dimensional energetics linked to surfaces,
interfaces, and fibers across multiple time and length scales for soft
multifunctional materials. We also conduct table-top experiments for
inspiration, validation, and fun!
