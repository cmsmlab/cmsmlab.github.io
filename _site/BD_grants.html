CAREER: Multiscale Mechanics of Highly Deformable Strain-Gradient Electric Generators

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support research that advances understanding of stretchable soft materials, a novel class of materials, and their ability to generate electricity through mechanical deformations. Traditional piezoelectric materials, which generate electricity when deformed, are typically limited to a narrow range of stiff, brittle materials that fail under even small strains. In contrast, this project explores the potential of using polymers, whose flexing mechanisms induce small-scale electrical polarization, the generate electricity. By investigating these mechanisms, this fundamental research intends to deepen our scientific understanding of soft materials and open the door to transformative applications, such as self-powered wearable and implantable technologies, active soft robotics, shape-conformal sensors, and energy harvesting devices. These innovations offer the potential to be both biocompatible and environmentally sustainable, thereby advancing national healthcare and energy solutions. Additionally, this project will create K-12 STEM teaching materials and provide educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a special emphasis on supporting first-generation students in interdisciplinary fields such as computational materials science, nano/micro-mechanics, electromechanics, and soft materials. Key findings will be integrated into graduate courses, ensuring that the next generation of researchers and engineers is well-prepared to lead in these emerging areas.

The CAREER project will support research that attempts to establish a multiscale framework to investigate how large strain gradients in polymer-based materials can induce electric polarization. Theoretical and computational models will be developed to link molecular-level polymer chain behavior to macroscopic electromechanical responses, accounting for both bulk and surface polarization effects. Advanced continuum models incorporating higher-order strain gradient theories will be used to capture the complex interplay between bulk and interface-driven mechanisms, which are particularly critical at small scales. These models will be validated through custom experiments conducted at submillimeter dimensions, where polymer specimens and 3D-printed architectures will be subjected to controlled loading conditions to generate measurable strain gradients and record the resulting electrical outputs. This integrated approach?combining theory, simulation, and experiments?will provide critical insights into the design and characterization of soft flexoelectric materials, paving the way for their use in sensing, actuation, and sustainable energy harvesting.

Collaborative Research: Exploring the Role of Ultra-Soft Inclusions in the Mechanics of Fibrous Materials

In nature, fibrous materials such as biological tissues can display adaptive behaviors. These include tunable density, stiffness, and permeability, which allow them to carry mechanical loads, respond to environmental stimuli, and heal wounds. These behaviors are achieved through ultra-soft inclusions like cells and platelets, and their interactions with the surrounding fibrous network, collectively lending their host materials specialized functions. Mimicking such functions in engineered materials requires a deep understanding of the mechanical role of ultra-soft inclusions in fiber networks at large deformations. This award supports fundamental research on how ultra-soft inclusions interact with a network of fibers and how these small-scale interactions affect the overall deformation behavior of the host material. The findings from this investigation will not only provide new insights into the design and fabrication of bio-inspired, adaptive materials for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable technology, wound healing, filtration membranes, and soft robotics, but it will also lead to a better understanding of physiological and pathological processes in biological tissues that are driven by ultra-soft inclusions in the form of cells and cell-like particles, consequently advancing the national health, prosperity, and welfare. In addition to benefitting the broader scientific community, this work will also support undergraduate and graduate education through new, interdisciplinary class modules, research opportunities, and a trans-institutional visitation program. An additional broader impact will be through an education outreach program aimed at middle school students in collaboration with a Department of Defense-affiliated STEM youth program in Austin, TX, inspiring the students to recognize the universality of many engineering principles spanning from biomedical engineering to civil and mechanical engineering.

Micron-sized, ultra-soft inclusions in fiber networks are ubiquitous in natural materials and play a critical role in the overall mechanical properties despite their small size. This award aims to understand how controlled microscale, local and non-local interactions of highly deformable inclusions with semi-flexible fiber networks lead to emergent behaviors at macroscales in engineered materials. The focus is on polymeric (fibrous) host materials for their importance in both engineering applications and nature. Computational approaches combine surface-enriched numerical tools accounting for bulk and surface adhesion, elastocapillary effects, soft solid-beam contact phenomena, and data-driven homogenization to predict the mechanics of polymer-particle composites. Critically, this project develops a controllable, experimental microgel platform to make and study ultra-soft inclusions with highly tunable mechanical properties. An iterative feedback loop between theory, computations, and micro- and macroscale experiments using the microgel material platform is central to the project for validating predictions and informing the model development. Ultimately, this project will provide a quantitative knowledge base and a microgel synthesis platform to demonstrate that the material design space of composites with ultra-soft inclusions can be precisely tuned through control of the nonlinear local/nonlocal interactions between ultra-soft inclusions and fibrous networks.

DMREF/Collaborative Research: Computationally Driven Design of Synthetic Tissue-Like Multifunctional Materials


In nature, living cells join to form tissues capable of collective behaviors, such as sensing and responding to external cues, communicating, sorting and storing chemical species, and adapting their mechanical properties to sustain necessary loads. Biological tissues achieve these desirable properties because of careful control over the contents, arrangements, and interconnections of individual cells, an approach that yields hierarchical materials with high levels of adaptability, responsiveness, and tunable mechanical strength. Replicating these types of emergent properties in synthetic materials remains a major engineering challenge. This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) award supports basic research and scientific development of material systems that mimic the composition, organization, and properties of living tissues. The computationally led designs of tissues-like materials with precise compositions and spatial arrangements seek to offer a generalizable solution for applications in artificial tissue replacement, wound healing, soft robotics, and embedded computing technologies. In addition, the project will support the technical and professional development of the STEM workforce by promoting the participation of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, especially from the first-generation and underrepresented groups, through various outreach and research activities.

This project aims to study synthetic tissues comprised of independent cell-like compartments coupled hierarchically through mechanical tethering (i.e., self-assembling block copolymer microgels (BCPs) as synthetic cytoskeleton) and selective transport (i.e., protein-enriched biomimetic membranes (BMs) as selective barriers) mechanisms and incorporating stimuli-responsiveness (e.g., via polymers and membrane proteins) into the compartments. Computational approaches combine molecular transport, stimuli-responsive coupled deformations of BCPs, intercompartment adhesion, and biomembrane mechanics to predict failure behaviors, emergent properties, and functionalities of tissue-like assemblies. An iterative feedback loop between theory, computations, synthesis of BCPs, 3D bioprinting, and microscale mechanical characterization is central to the project for validating predictions, informing model development, and creating a modular database. The construction of a compartmentalized material system that exhibits selective internal transport pathways via lipid- and protein-based BMs and tunable mechanical properties via BCPs will be achieved by understanding how the tunable hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of BCPs: 1) interact with amphiphilic BMs at the nanoscale; 2) self-assemble and entangle to form solid-like gels at the microscale; 3) cross-link between compartments at the macroscale to rigidify the entire assembly. Ultimately, this project will provide the quantitative knowledge base and modular design criteria to accelerate the assembly and use of compartmentalized tissue-like materials that are multifunctional, stimuli-responsive, adaptable, tough, and operate outside of equilibrium.
