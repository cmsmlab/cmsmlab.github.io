This paper introduces a new class of ultra-soft, solid-like materials—Jammed Interconnected Bilayer Emulsions (JIBEs)—comprising billions of bilayer-separated aqueous compartments that self-assemble into a robust, solid-like network.

This paper proposes a new stabilization method within a mixed Material Point Method (MPM) framework that achieves linear-linear as well as higher-order B-spline mixed interpolations. MPM is a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian particle-based approach. Our work advances MPM development for multiphysics simulations of soft polymeric materials.

            This paper develops a 3D computational model for curvature-resisting material surfaces using surface-enriched isogeometric analysis. By introducing an elastobending length scale, the method captures surface bending effects that stiffen overall material response and enables accurate modeling of complex deformations in soft solids and biological membranes.

              <p>Soft materials are an important class of materials. They play critical roles both in nature, in the form of soft tissues, and in industrial applications. Quantifying their mechanical properties is an important part of understanding and predicting their behavior, and thus optimizing their use. However, there are often no agreed upon standards for how to do so. This also holds true for quantifying their fracture toughness; that is, their resistance to crack propagation. The goal of our work is to fill this knowledge gap using blood clot as a model material. In total, we compared three general approaches, some with multiple different implementations. The first approach is based on Griffith’s definition of the critical energy release rate. The second approach makes use of the J-Integral. The last approach uses cohesive zones. We applied these approaches to 12 pure shear experiments with notched samples (some approaches were supplemented with unnotched samples). Finally, we compared these approaches by their intra- and inter-approach variability, the complexity of their implementation, and their computational cost. Overall, we found that the simplest method was also the most consistent and the least costly one: the Griffith-based approach, as proposed by Rivlin and Thomas in 1953.</p>

              <p>We present Jammed Interconnected Bilayer Emulsions (JIBEs) as a class of tissue-like materials with macroscopic scalability and rapid fabrication, comprising millions to billions of bilayer-separated aqueous compartments.

              <p>Subjected to external loadings, polymeric materials, e.g., biological tissues, hydrogels, and elastomers, may undergo extreme, nearly incompressible, (self-)contact deformations. For numerical modeling employing mesh-based techniques such as the finite element method (FEM), these deformations pose significant challenges due to large distortions in the deformed geometry, accuracy issues stemming from volumetric locking effects, and increased computational cost from complex contact searches. As an alternative to mesh-based methods, the material point method (MPM), a continuum-based particle technique, is gaining attention for its ability to handle extreme distortions and capture no-slip contact without added cost. For nearly incompressible material behaviors, while mixed formulations can address locking effects by treating displacements and pressure as independent fields, they can suffer from numerical instabilities close to the incompressibility limit due to the violation of the inf-sup condition, leading to inaccurate nodal pressure solutions. Here we propose an efficient and stable mixed B-spline material point method with highest achievable regularity for quasi-compressible polymeric materials. Using the two-scale relation of B-splines, we introduce a subdivision-stabilization for the two-field mixed MPM and obtain numerically stable, oscillation-free nodal solutions with equal-order interpolations with optimal regularity. Building on the Eulerian-Lagrangian nature of MPM, a previously-converged solution framework is adopted to mitigate issues related to cell-crossing and numerical fracture artifact present in standard MPM. We assess the stability and accuracy of the developed mixed MPM at large deformations for soft materials through the benchmark Cook’s membrane problem. Additionally, we test the robustness of the proposed MPM by modeling several examples, including the compression and indentation of a circular block into a quasi-compressible substrate and the twisting deformation of a rectangular block. The findings demonstrate the MPM’s capabilities for modeling practical soft material applications.</p>

              <p>Attachment of bacteria onto a surface, consequent signaling, and accumulation and growth of the surface-bound bacterial population are key initial steps in the formation of pathogenic biofilms. While recent reports have hinted that surface mechanics may affect the accumulation of bacteria on that surface, the processes that underlie bacterial perception of surface mechanics and modulation of accumulation in response to surface mechanics remain largely unknown. We use thin and thick hydrogels coated on glass to create composite materials with different mechanics (higher elasticity for thin composites; lower elasticity for thick composites) but with the same surface adhesivity and chemistry. The mechanical cue stemming from surface mechanics is elucidated using experiments with the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined with finite-element modeling. Adhesion to thin composites results in greater changes in mechanical stress and strain in the bacterial envelope than does adhesion to thick composites with identical surface chemistry. Using quantitative microscopy, we find that adhesion to thin composites also results in higher cyclic-di-GMP levels, which in turn result in lower motility and less detachment, and thus greater accumulation of bacteria on the surface than does adhesion to thick composites. Mechanics-dependent c-di-GMP production is mediated by the cell-surface-exposed protein PilY1. The biofilm lag phase, which is longer for bacterial populations on thin composites than on thick composites, is also mediated by PilY1. This study shows clear evidence that bacteria actively regulate differential accumulation on surfaces of different stiffnesses via perceiving varied mechanical stress and strain upon surface engagement.</p>

    abstract = {Attachment of bacteria onto a surface, consequent signaling, and accumulation and growth of the surface-bound bacterial population are key initial steps in the formation of pathogenic biofilms. While recent reports have hinted that surface mechanics may affect the accumulation of bacteria on that surface, the processes that underlie bacterial perception of surface mechanics and modulation of accumulation in response to surface mechanics remain largely unknown. We use thin and thick hydrogels coated on glass to create composite materials with different mechanics (higher elasticity for thin composites; lower elasticity for thick composites) but with the same surface adhesivity and chemistry. The mechanical cue stemming from surface mechanics is elucidated using experiments with the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined with finite-element modeling. Adhesion to thin composites results in greater changes in mechanical stress and strain in the bacterial envelope than does adhesion to thick composites with identical surface chemistry. Using quantitative microscopy, we find that adhesion to thin composites also results in higher cyclic-di-GMP levels, which in turn result in lower motility and less detachment, and thus greater accumulation of bacteria on the surface than does adhesion to thick composites. Mechanics-dependent c-di-GMP production is mediated by the cell-surface-exposed protein PilY1. The biofilm lag phase, which is longer for bacterial populations on thin composites than on thick composites, is also mediated by PilY1. This study shows clear evidence that bacteria actively regulate differential accumulation on surfaces of different stiffnesses via perceiving varied mechanical stress and strain upon surface engagement.},

              <p>Soft materials are of major interest for biomechanics applications due to their high deformability and susceptibility to experience damage events under different loading scenarios. The present study is concerned with modelling damage evolution processes in these nonlinear materials whose structural responses are prone to locking when low-order kinematic interpolation is employed in the context of nonlinear Finite Element schemes. For this reason, a pair of gradient-enhanced continuum damage schemes are proposed with the aim of tackling mechanical failure problems in applications that exhibit shear and volumetric locking. In particular, we present the consistent formulation and the assessment of the corresponding performance of (i) a mixed displacement-enhanced assumed strain Q1Q1E24 employing a total Lagrangian formulation, and (ii) a three-field mixed displacement-pressure-Jacobian Q1Q1P0 formulation. The novel Q1Q1E24 and Q1Q1P0 formulations are consistently derived and numerically implemented, providing a satisfactory agreement with respect to ABAQUS built-in elements handling the treatment of shear and volumetric locking, respectively, in conjunction to the modelling damage phenomena via the use of a penalty-based gradient-enhanced formulation. This performance is examined via several numerical applications. Furthermore, the final example justifies the need for a formulation combining both mixed FE approaches to simulate problems encompassing both locking issues (shear and volumetric locking), which can be performed using a combination of the Q1Q1E24 and Q1Q1P0 herein proposed.</p>

              <p>Periventricular white matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a common finding in medical images of the aging brain and are associated with white matter damage resulting from cerebral small vessel disease, white matter inflammation, and a degeneration of the lateral ventricular wall. Despite extensive work, the etiology of periventricular WMHs remains unclear. We pose that there is a strong coupling between age-related ventricular expansion and the degeneration of the ventricular wall which leads to a dysregulated fluid exchange across this brain–fluid barrier. Here, we present a multiphysics model that couples cerebral atrophy-driven ventricular wall loading with periventricular WMH formation and progression. We use patient data to create eight 2D finite element models and demonstrate the predictive capabilities of our damage model. Our simulations show that we accurately capture the spatiotemporal features of periventricular WMH growth. For one, we observe that damage appears first in both the anterior and posterior horns and then spreads into deeper white matter tissue. For the other, we note that it takes up to 12 years before periventricular WMHs first appear and derive an average annualized periventricular WMH damage growth rate of 15.2 ± 12.7mm2/year across our models. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our model parameters provide sufficient sensitivity to rationalize subject-specific differences with respect to onset time and damage growth. Moreover, we show that the septum pellucidum, a membrane that separates the left and right lateral ventricles, delays the onset of periventricular WMHs at first, but leads to a higher WMH load in the long-term. Statement of Significance: Brain aging is accompanied by many structural and functional changes. In nearly all aged brains, white matter lesions appear in periventricular and diffuse subcortical regions which are associated with progressive functional decline. In our work, we present a multiphysics model that not only predicts the onset location of periventricular white matter lesions but also their subsequent growth as a result of age-related cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement. Our model provides a mechanics-based rationale for their characteristic spatiotemporal progression patterns and will allow to identify at-risk subjects for early lesion formation.</p>

              <p>Improved understanding of solid surface energy and its role in the overall mechanical properties is of great interest due to the emerging manufacturing techniques of nanostructures, coatings, and synthetic/biological bilayer–polymer hybrids. Continuum numerical modeling of surface stresses efficiently incorporates a zero-thickness membrane bonded to a bulk, intrinsically accounting for surface tension and surface elasticity. Compressive surface stresses are not possible in a purely membrane formulation, ignoring the surface flexural resistance. The extension of material surfaces to account for flexural resistance, i.e., the Steigmann–Ogden model, requires spatial derivatives of second order, posing significant challenges to standard discretization techniques. Hence, the effect of surface curvature resistance on the overall mechanical behavior of complex geometries remains elusive. Here, we develop a three-dimensional computational formulation of curvature-dependent surface energetics at finite strains using surface-enriched isogeometric analysis. Coupled with a hyperelastic bulk, bending-resistance of material surfaces furnishes a new physical length scale, i.e., the elastobending length. We quantify the effect of elastobending deformations for several numerical examples involving soft materials with thin coatings and liquid-shell surfaces, capturing budding-like behavior observed at cell membranes. Our results demonstrate a stiffer overall mechanical behavior when material surfaces resist bending deformations and illustrate how curvature effects lead to complex budding deformations at non-zero initial curvature states. The proposed methodology provides a robust computational foundation to help improve our understanding and mechanical characterization of soft solids, nanostructures, and biological membranes at small scales.</p>

              <p>Solid surface tension can deform soft elastic materials at macroscopic length scales. At a critical surface tension, elastocapillary instabilities in soft filaments emerge that resemble the Plateau–Rayleigh (P–R) instabilities in liquids. The experimentally observed P–R instability of soft elastic filaments has been recently investigated via numerical and theoretical approaches. However, these contributions focus on the incompressible limit and preclude the nonlinear Poisson’s ratio effects in materials, for example, compressible hydrogels with Poisson’s ratios that can go as low as 0.1. Moreover, most of the research on the solid P–R instability elaborate on the onset, ignoring the post-bifurcation regime. Here we show that compressibility matters and the form of the assumed compressible strain energy density has a significant effect on the onset and the post-bifurcation behavior of elastic P–R instability. For example, the P–R instability can be entirely suppressed depending on the form of the free energy density and Poisson’s ratio.

    abstract = {Solid surface tension can deform soft elastic materials at macroscopic length scales. At a critical surface tension, elastocapillary instabilities in soft filaments emerge that resemble the Plateau–Rayleigh (P–R) instabilities in liquids. The experimentally observed P–R instability of soft elastic filaments has been recently investigated via numerical and theoretical approaches. However, these contributions focus on the incompressible limit and preclude the nonlinear Poisson’s ratio effects in materials, for example, compressible hydrogels with Poisson’s ratios that can go as low as 0.1. Moreover, most of the research on the solid P–R instability elaborate on the onset, ignoring the post-bifurcation regime. Here we show that compressibility matters and the form of the assumed compressible strain energy density has a significant effect on the onset and the post-bifurcation behavior of elastic P–R instability. For example, the P–R instability can be entirely suppressed depending on the form of the free energy density and Poisson’s ratio. To this end, we employ a robust and variational elastocapillary formulation and its computer implementation using surface-enriched isogeometric finite elements at finite strains. We use an arclength solver to illustrate both stable-unstable amplitude growth and bifurcation points in the entire equilibrium path. Stability maps are drawn with distinct stable-unstable regions over various shear moduli, surface tensions, fiber radii, and applied stretches for cases ranging from quasi-compressible to fully compressible.

              <p>Excessive bleeding—or hemorrhage—causes millions of civilian and non-civilian casualties every year. Additionally, wound sequelae, such as infections, are a significant source of chronic morbidity, even if the initial bleeding is successfully stopped. To treat acute and chronic wounds, numerous wound healing materials have been identified, tested, and adopted. Among them are topical dressings, such as gauzes, as well as natural and biomimetic materials. However, none of these materials successfully mimic the complex and dynamic properties of the body’s own wound healing material: the blood clot. Specifically, blood clots exhibit complex mechanical and biochemical properties that vary across spatial and temporal scales to guide the wound healing response, which make them the ideal wound healing material. In this manuscript, we review blood clots’ complex mechanical and biochemical properties, review current wound healing materials, and identify opportunities where new materials can provide additional functionality, with a specific focus on hydrogels. We highlight recent developments in synthetic hydrogels that make them capable of mimicking a larger subset of blood clot features: as plugs and as stimuli for tissue repair. We conclude that future hydrogel materials designed to mimic blood clot biochemistry, mechanics, and architecture can be combined with exciting platelet-like particles to serve as hemostats that also promote the biological wound healing response. Thus, we believe synthetic hydrogels are ideal candidates to address the clear need for better wound healing materials.</p>

              <p>Blood clots play a diametric role in our bodies as they are both vital as a wound sealant, as well as the source for many devastating diseases. In blood clots’ physiological and pathological roles, their mechanics play a critical part. These mechanics are non-trivial owing to blood clots’ complex nonlinear, viscoelastic behavior. Casting this behavior into mathematical form is a fundamental step toward a better basic scientific understanding of blood clots, as well as toward diagnostic and prognostic computational models. Here, we identify a hyper-viscoelastic damage model that we fit to original data on the nonlinear, viscoelastic behavior of blood clots. Our model combines the classic Ogden hyperelastic constitutive law, a finite viscoelastic model for large deformations, and a non-local, gradient-enhanced damage formulation. By fitting our model to cyclic tensile test data and extension-to-failure data, we inform the model’s nine unknown material parameters. We demonstrate the predictability of our model by validating it against unseen cyclic tensile test and stress-relaxation data. Our original data, model formulation, and the identified constitutive parameters of this model are openly available for others to use, which will aid in developing accurate, quantitative simulations of blood clot mechanics.</p>

              <p>Instabilities that form when a domain of compliant elastic material goes under compressive forces are prevalent in nature and have found many applications. Even though instabilities are observed in a myriad of fields and materials, the large deformation bifurcation analysis of compressible domains, may it be beams, half-spaces, or bilayers, remains understudied compared to the incompressible case. In this work, we present a unifying approach for the instability analysis of a compressible elastic domain under plane deformations, wherein the unifying approach is then particularized for beams, half-spaces, and bilayers. First, the large-deformation incremental analysis for a rectangular, compressible, hyperelastic domain under plane deformations is developed, which serves as a generic and all-encompassing framework for other geometries. Subsequently, this generic framework is applied to the specific domains of beam, half-space, and lastly as the superimposition of the two; bilayer. Obtained analytical results for the onset of wrinkling in the beam, half-space and bilayer geometries are explored in the full range of compressibility and for various geometrical parameters, including their comparison with computational simulations using the finite element method, cultivating excellent agreements between analytical and numerical results all across the material and geometrical parameter spectrum. The analytical framework presented here provides grounds for further works on other modes of instabilities and more complex geometries.</p>

              <p>The cerebellum is a tightly folded structure located at the back of the head. Unlike the folds of the cerebrum, the folds of the cerebellum are aligned such that the external surface appears to be covered in parallel grooves. Experiments have shown that anchoring center initiation drives cerebellar foliation. However, the mechanism guiding the location of these anchoring centers, and subsequently cerebellar morphology, remains poorly understood. In particular, there is no definitive mechanistic explanation for the preferential emergence of parallel folds instead of an irregular folding pattern like in the cerebral cortex. Here we use mechanical modeling on the cellular and tissue scales to show that the oriented granule cell division observed in the experimental setting leads to the characteristic parallel folding pattern of the cerebellum. Specifically, we propose an agent-based model of cell clones, a strategy for propagating information from our in silico cell clones to the tissue scale, and an analytical solution backed by numerical results to understand how differential growth between the cerebellar layers drives geometric instability in three dimensional space on the tissue scale. This proposed mechanical model provides further insight into the process of anchoring center initiation and establishes a framework for future multiscale mechanical analysis of developing organs.</p>

              <p>Under a variety of external stimuli, hydrogels can undergo coupled solid deformation and fluid diffusion and exhibit large volume changes. The numerical analysis of this process can be complicated by numerical instabilities when using mixed formulations due to the violation of the inf-sup condition. In addition, the large deformations produce complex instability patterns causing singularities in the underlying set of equations. For these reasons, the experimentally observed complex patterns remain elusive and poorly understood. Furthermore, a stability criterion suitable to detect critical conditions and predict post-instability patterns is lacking for hydrogel simulations. Here we investigate the stability criterion for coupled problems with a saddle point nature and propose a generic framework to study diffusion-driven swelling-induced instabilities of hydrogels.

    abstract = {Under a variety of external stimuli, hydrogels can undergo coupled solid deformation and fluid diffusion and exhibit large volume changes. The numerical analysis of this process can be complicated by numerical instabilities when using mixed formulations due to the violation of the inf-sup condition. In addition, the large deformations produce complex instability patterns causing singularities in the underlying set of equations. For these reasons, the experimentally observed complex patterns remain elusive and poorly understood. Furthermore, a stability criterion suitable to detect critical conditions and predict post-instability patterns is lacking for hydrogel simulations. Here we investigate the stability criterion for coupled problems with a saddle point nature and propose a generic framework to study diffusion-driven swelling-induced instabilities of hydrogels. Adopting a numerically stable subdivision-based mixed isogeometric analysis, we show that the proposed framework for stability analysis accurately captures instability points during the transient swelling of hydrogels. The influence of geometrical and material parameters on the critical conditions are also presented in stability diagrams for two useful problems involving the buckling of hydrogel rods and the wrinkling on the surface of hydrogel bilayers.

              <p>The objective of this contribution is to establish a computational framework to study growth-induced instabilities. The common approach towards growth-induced instabilities is to decompose the deformation multiplicatively into its growth and elastic part. Recently, this concept has been employed in computations of growing continua and has proven to be extremely useful to better understand the material behavior under growth. While finite element simulations seem to be capable of predicting the behavior of growing continua, they often cannot naturally capture the instabilities caused by growth. The accepted strategy to provoke growth-induced instabilities is therefore to perturb the solution of the problem, which indeed results in geometric instabilities in the form of wrinkles and folds. However, this strategy is intrinsically subjective as the user is prescribing the perturbations and the simulations are often highly perturbation-dependent. We propose a different strategy that is inherently suitable for this problem, namely eigenvalue analysis. The main advantages of eigenvalue analysis are that first, no arbitrary, artificial perturbations are needed and second, it is, in general, independent of the time step size. Therefore, the solution obtained by this methodology is not subjective and thus, is generic and reproducible. Equipped with eigenvalue analysis, we are able to compute precisely the critical growth to initiate instabilities. Furthermore, this strategy allows us to compare different finite elements for this family of problems. Our results demonstrate that linear elements perform strikingly poorly, as compared to quadratic elements.</p>
